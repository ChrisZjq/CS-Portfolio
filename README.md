2 Introduction

This page serves as a list of projects that Chris accomplished through various classes during his pursuit of a Computer Science degree in Grand Canyon University. 

Languages used by these projects include: C++, C#, JavaScript, SQL, Python, GLSL, HTML, MIPS Assembly.

Concepts included in these projects include: OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms, Web Development, Relational Database, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Linear Algebra, Computer Graphics, Mathematical Modeling.

3 Machine Learning (CST-425)

This class is an implementation of various machine learning algorithms and methods through a web app. The app includes demos for text classification and image detection using Naive Bayes, KNN, K-means clustering, TFIDF in R.

4 Operating Systemn (CST-315)

This class is about simulation of a process scheduler on top of virtual memory. The simulation implements both paging and segmentation for virtual memory. The algorithm for process scheduler is Shortest Process Next. The project is written in C++.

5 Predator Prey Model (CST-301)

This class is about simulates predator and prey interactivity between the rabbits and foxes using, in which rabbits will act as the prey and foxes as the predator. It will be based off of the Lotka-Volterra model. Additionally, the model will include seasonal migration. This project is written in Python

6 OpenGL Computer Graphics (CST-310)

This class is about 3D model for different shapes and object. The project implements computer graphics concepts such as lighting, projection, scaling, texture, etc. Note that all the components are built from scratch without libraries such as three.js. The class was taught in C++ with OpenGL.

7 Assembly to Binary Converter (CST-301)

This class was about converts MIPS assembly instructions to binary and hex code. The project is written in MIPS Assembly Language.

8 3D Mixed Reality Simulation (CST-320)

This class uses Unity to create a mixed reality application running on MS HoloLens to offer an innovative methodology for conducting an academic physics lab. This project is written in C#.

9 Principal Component Analysis (CST-435)

This project uses Principal Component Analysis to train the model to be able to recognize images of objects of different categories. The project is written in Matlab.

10 Data Structure Maze Solving (CST-210)

This class was about creates a maze based on an input text file. It then attempts to solve the maze depth-first using stack, breath-first using queue, or shortest-distance-next using heap and visualizes it through an interactive web application. This project is written in C#, JavaScript (React).

11 Database Design (CST-217)

The class was about database design and implementation for storing climate information of multiple locations.

12 Object Oriented Programming (CST-201)

This class was about writing a Fantasy Fighting Arena that allow players to purchase goods and fight battles. It demonstrates concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and File/IO . This project is written in C++.
